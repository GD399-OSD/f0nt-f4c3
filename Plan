FONT-FACE PROPOSAL

Design a Monospaced Display typeface for the headlines in our classes open source book. (Assuming everyone else approves)
The typecace will be only uppercase characters with basic punctuation. (possibly numerals?)

OR

Alter an open source typeface. 

Beyond the basic function of headline text (maybe for our classes book?) the project will also function as an open source experiment.
We have never collaborated on a typeface and are unfamiliar with the open source software Fontforge.
This will provide us with the opportunity to document our process for the book in the hopes that it might help future students
approach type design collaboration, opensource software, and the opensource community.

We plan on acheiving this by:

1. Share your process
  - Include failed attempts
  - Mention who inspired you

2. Share your source files

3. Collaborate
  - Group work
  - Class critiques

4. Contribute
  - Document our experience working with font forge
  - Document suggestions/feedback for the Font Forge software.
